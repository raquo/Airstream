/** This signal behaves a bit differently than other signals typically do:
  * it keeps track of state regardless of whether it is started.
  * This is possible because this case requires no special memory management.
  *
  * Note that being a StrictSignal, this exposes `now` and `tryNow` methods,
  * however if the `future` was not yet completed when this signal was created,
  * this signal's current value will be updated *asynchronously* after the future
  * has completed.
