/** A Sink is something that can be converted to an [[Observer]]. The
  * counterparty to Sink is a [[Source]], something that can be converted to an
  * [[Observable]].
  *
  * A Sink could be an Observer itself, an EventBus, a Var, or, via implicits,
  * an external type like js.Function1.
  *
  * The point of using Sink instead of Observer in your API is to let the end
  * users pass simply `eventBus` instead of `eventBus.writer` to a method that
  * requires Sink, and to achieve that without having an implicit conversion
  * from EventBus to Observer, because then you'd also want an implicit
  * conversion from EventBus to Observable, and those two would be incompatible
  * (e.g. both Observable and Observer have a filter method).
