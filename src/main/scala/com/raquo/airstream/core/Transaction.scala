  * - All observables that can create loops in the observable graph (e.g. flatMapSwitch)
  * - All observables that get their events from outside of Airstream (e.g. custom sources)

     * in `shared` has finished executing. You can nest `shared` calls if
     * needed, and Airstream will wait for the outermost `shared` block to
     * finish running before executing all pendingCallbacks. Currently this
     * logic is only used to fire those signal.changes events.
     *
     * To be more specific, once the outermost `shared` block finishes executing,
     * a new transaction will be created, and inside of it, all pending callbacks
     * will be executed. Aside from having the benefit of executing after all
     * the desired observers have been added, this also has the benefit of sending
     * out all of those events in the same transaction. This is done to eliminate
     * glitches (Airstream can avoid FRP glitches only inside a single transaction),
     * however this can introduce other glitch-like differences in behaviour
     * compared to the normal flow of events, e.g. observables that could otherwise
     * never possibly emit an event in the same transaction, might do so when
     * they're both triggered by this mechanism at the same time. However, in
     * practice this should hopefully be almost unnoticeable, as the conditions
     * required to trigger this mechanism are rather specific, and the expected
     * type of glitches are less likely to be disruptive than the usual ones.
     *
     * If you rely on standard Laminar features for automatic management of
     * subscriptions, you shouldn't ever need to call this manually.
