/** A Source is something that can be converted to an [[Observable]]. The
  * counterparty to Source is a [[Sink]], something that can be converted to an
  * [[Observer]].
  *
  * A Source could be an Observable itself, an EventBus, a Var, or, via
  * implicits, a third party type like Future or ZIO.
  *
  * The point of using Source instead of Observable in your API is to let the
  * end users pass simply `eventBus` instead of `eventBus.events` to a method
  * that requires Source, and to achieve that without having an implicit
  * conversion from EventBus to Observable, because then you'd also want an
  * implicit conversion from EventBus to Observer, and those two would be
  * incompatible (e.g. both Observable and Observer have a filter method).
