/** Represents a leaky resource such as a
  * [[com.raquo.airstream.core.Subscription]] or a
  * [[com.raquo.airstream.eventbus.EventBusSource]]
  *
  * Due to circular references, such resources will leak memory if
  * not explicitly disabled. Well, unless the whole Signal/Stream graph that
  * a given [[Owned]] depends on becomes unreachable, which might never happen.
  *
  * So, such leaky resources can only be instantiated if they notify their [[Owner]]
  * about their existence. The owner is something that knows when these resources
  * are no longer needed. For example, an owner could be a UI component that knows
  * when it was unmounted / discarded. The component would then `kill`s the Signals
  * and Subscriptions that were defined to belong to it upon creation.
  *
  * You can implement your own Owner-s and Owned-s. The "leaks" in question don't
  * need to be memory leaks. It could be any sort of lifecycle management as long
  * as it can be mapped to this API.
