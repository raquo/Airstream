/** This subscription is hyper dynamic, allowing you to change DynamicOwner on the fly.
  *
  * It works by creating DynamicSubscription-s under the hood with your provided owner and activate()
  * and deactivate() methods, but it has a special semantic: when transferring this subscription
  * from one active DynamicOwner to another active DynamicOwner, neither activate() nor deactivate()
  * are called because continuity of active ownership is maintained.
  *
  * So in effect, this subscription only cares whether it's owned or not, so it does not expose the
  * owner to you: notice the `activate` callback is not provided with an Owner.
  *
  * An example of where this is useful is tracking mounting and unmounting of elements in Laminar.
  * If an element is mounted, we want to call activate(), if unmounted, we want to call deactivate(),
  * but if the element is MOVED from one mounted parent to another mounted parent, it just remains
  * mounted, this transition is of no interest to us. If not for this subscription's special design,
  * we would need to call deactivate() to "detach" the subscription from its old parent's owner and
  * then immediately afterwards call activate() to "attach" the subscription to the new parent's owner,
  * but that would deactivate and then immediately re-activate all subscriptions on the Laminar element
  * being moved (and all of its descendants), which would be very wasteful. Well, you do need to know
  * Laminar to understand this example.
