/** Represents a subscription that can be turned on and off repeatedly. For
  * example, in Laminar the elements can be mounted and unmounted repeatedly,
  * and so their subscriptions are activated and deactivated respectively when
  * those events happen.
  *
  * In contrast, the only thing you can do to a non-dynamic [[Subscription]] is
  * `kill` it, and once that is done, it will remain dead forever.
  *
  * Note that the dynamic subscription is NOT activated automatically upon
  * creation.
  *
  * The subscription created by `activate` must not be killed externally,
  * otherwise DynamicSubscription will throw when it tries to kill it and it's
  * already killed.
  *
  * @param activate
  *   \- Note: Must not throw!
  * @param prepend
  *   \- If true, dynamic owner will prepend subscription to the list instead of
  *   appending. This affects activation and deactivation order of
  *   subscriptions.
