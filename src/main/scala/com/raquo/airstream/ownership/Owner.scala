/** Owner decides when to kill its subscriptions.
  * - Ownership is defined at creation of the [[Subscription]]
  * - Ownership is non-transferable
  * - There is no way to unkill a Subscription
  * - In other words: Owner can only own a Subscription once,
  *   and a Subscription can only ever be owned by its initial owner
  * - Owner can still be used after calling killPossessions, but the canonical
  *   use case is for the Owner to kill its possessions when the owner itself
  *   is discarded (e.g. a UI component is unmounted).
  *
  * If you need something more flexible, use [[DynamicOwner]],
  * or build your own custom logic on top of this in a similar manner.
