//  - We track a list of subscriptions and when activating / deactivating we run user code on each subscription
//  - This is potentially dangerous because said user code could add / remove more subscriptions from this DynamicOwner
//  - I think I've addressed those issues with `pendingSubscriptionRemovals`, but need to be very careful when changing anything here.
//  - Small things like `foreach` caching `subscriptions.length` are very important.
