/** Event stream that mimics the parent event stream (both events and errors)
  * for as long as `takeWhile` returns true. As soon as `takeWhile` returns
  * `false` for the first time, it stops emitting anything.
  *
  * @param takeWhile
  *   nextEvent => shouldDrop Function which determines whether this stream
  *   should take the given event. Warning: MUST NOT THROW!
  *
  * @param reset
  *   This is called when this stream is stopped if resetOnStop is true. Use it
  *   to reset your `takeWhile` function's internal state, if needed. Warning:
  *   MUST NOT THROW!
  *
  * @param resetOnStop
  *   If true, stopping this stream will reset the stream's memory of previously
  *   taken events (up to you to implement the `reset` as far as your
  *   `takeWhile` function is concerned though).
