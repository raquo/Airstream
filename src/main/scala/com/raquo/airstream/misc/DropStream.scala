/** Event stream that mimics the parent event stream, except that first it skips
  * (drops) the parent's events, for as long as `dropWhile` returns true. As
  * soon as it returns false for the first time, it starts mirroring the parent
  * stream faithfully.
  *
  * Note: only events are dropped, not errors.
  *
  * @param dropWhile
  *   nextEvent => shouldDrop Function which determines whether this stream
  *   should drop the given event. Warning: MUST NOT THROW!
  *
  * @param reset
  *   This is called when this stream is stopped if resetOnStop is true. Use it
  *   to reset your `dropWhile` function's internal state, if needed. Warning:
  *   MUST NOT THROW!
  *
  * @param resetOnStop
  *   If true, stopping this stream will reset the stream's memory of previously
  *   dropped events (up to you to implement the `reset` as far as your
  *   `dropWhile` function is concerned though).
