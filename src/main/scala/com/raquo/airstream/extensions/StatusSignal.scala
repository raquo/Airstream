    *   whenever parent signal switches from `Resolved` to `Pending`, or when
    *   the signal's initial value is evaluated (and it's `Pending`, as is
    *   typical) `signalOfPendingValues` starts with `initialPending` value, and

    *   after another `Resolved`. This happens when the signal emits inputs
    *   faster than the outputs are resolved.
