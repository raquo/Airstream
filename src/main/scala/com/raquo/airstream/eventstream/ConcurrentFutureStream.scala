/** This stream emits the values that the parent observables' emitted futures resolve with,
  * in the order in which they resolve (which is likely different from the order in which the futures are emitted).
  *
  * @param dropPreviousValues if enabled, this option makes this stream NOT emit values of futures that were emitted
  *                           earlier than a future that has already resolved. So if the parent stream emits
  *                           three futures and the third one resolves before the first two, this stream will NOT emit
  *                           the values of the first two futures when they resolve.
  *                           This option is useful for applications such as autocomplete results
