/** This signal MUST be sync delayed after the split signal to prevent it from
  * emitting unwanted events. The reason is... complicated.
  *
  * Also, this signal is initialized at a strange time. It depends on `parent`,
  * but it is initialized while `parent` is propagating an event. So this signal
  * can be *started* during this propagation too (e.g. in Laminar use case).
  * Since this is a signal, when started it provides its initial value to its
  * observers. However because the parent's event is still propagating, it would
  * ALSO cause this signal to fire that event â€“ which is the same as its initial
  * value. This duplicity is undesirable of course, so we take care of it by
  * dropping the first event after initialization IF it happens during the
  * transaction in which this signal was initialized.
  *
  * @param initialValue
  *   note that this can get stale - always try to read memoized value first.
  *
  * @param getMemoizedValue
  *   get the latest memoized value and its corresponding parentLastUpdateId.
