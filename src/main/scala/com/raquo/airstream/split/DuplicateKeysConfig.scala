package com.raquo.airstream.split

/** .split() operator does not tolerate duplicate keys, i.e. the Seq you provide
  * it must not contain records that have the same `key(record)`.
  *
  * However, checking for duplicate keys can get expensive when splitting very
  * large lists, so this setting can be used to disable the checks.
  *
  * When warnings are enabled, YOUR CODE WILL STILL BREAK if the .split()
  * operator encounters duplicate keys, but it will first print a warning in the
  * browser console listing the duplicate keys at fault.
  *
  * We enable this setting by default to aid in debugging. As the end user, you
  * might want to disable this either globally or for specific .split() usages
  * to improve performance on very large lists.
  *
  * #TODO[Docs]: Add a short section to the docs about this.
  *
  * #TODO: Add more granular control later, if there is demand for that. For
  * example, we could instruct Airstream to skip duplicate keys, or to raise an
  * exception if a duplicate happens. In the latter case perhaps we could do
  * that by catching the right exception, without the overhead of checking for
  * duplicates. But not sure how bulletproof that logic would be.
