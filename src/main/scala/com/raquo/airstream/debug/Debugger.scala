/** Debugger for observables
  *
  * @param onEvalFromParent
  *   Only for signals. Fired when signal calls `currentValueFromParent`, which
  *   happens 1) when the signal is first started and its initial value is
  *   evaluated, AND 2) also when the signal is re-started after being stopped,
  *   when that method is called to re-sync this signal's value with the parent.
  *   #TODO[Integrity]: I'm not 100% sure if this hook reports correctly.
  *   - It actually reports the debugger signal's own calls to
  *     currentValueFromParent and I'm not 100% sure that they match with the
  *     parent's calls. I think they should match, at least if parent signal is
  *     always used via its debug signal, but to be honest I'm not really sure.
