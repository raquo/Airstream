Airstream is a small state propagation and streaming library. Primary differences from other solutions:

- **Mandatory [ownership](#ownership) of leaky resources** – it is impossible to create a subscription without specifying when it shall be destroyed. This helps prevent memory leaks and unexpected behaviour.

- **No [FRP glitches](#frp-glitches)** – neither observables themselves nor their observers will ever see inconsistent state within a transaction, at no runtime cost.

- **One integrated system for two core types of observables** – Event streams alone are not a good enough abstraction for anything other than events.
  - EventStream for events (lazy, no current value)
  - Signal for state (lazy, has current value)

- **Small size, simple implementation** – easy to understand, easy to create custom observables. Does not bloat your Scala.js bundle size.

Airstream has a very generic design, but is primarily intended to serve as a reactive layer for unidirectional dataflow architecture as applied to hierarchical UI components. As such, it is not burdened by features that cause more problems than they solve in frontend development, such as backpressure and typed effects.

I created Airstream because I found existing solutions were not suitable for building reactive UI components. My original need for Airstream was to replace the previous reactive layer of [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar), but I'll be happy to see it used by other reactive UI libraries as well. Laminar in general is well modularized, and you can definitely reuse other bits and pieces of it, for example [Scala DOM Types](https://github.com/raquo/scala-dom-types).

## Documentation

The provided documentation is a high level overview that occasionally dives into gritty details for things that are hard to figure on your own. It is not a full replacement to discovering available methods by reading the code (which is quite simple, and has comments) or simply with an IDE's autocomplete functionality.

This documentation is not an introduction to functional reactive programming. Instead, it explains the specifics of one library. I therefore assume basic knowledge of streams and observables here. If you need a primer on standard reactive programming, consider [this guide](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) by André Staltz or its [video adaptation](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-reactive-programming). 

This documentation is intended to be read top to bottom, sections further down the line assume knowledge of concepts and behaviours introduced in earlier sections.

Warning: there is some rambling involved. I will need to revise this at some point.

For examples of Airstream code, see [laminar-examples](https://github.com/raquo/laminar-examples), [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar) source code, as well as Airstream tests.


### EventStream

EventStream is a reactive variable that represents a stream of discrete events.

EventStream has no concept of "current value". It is a stream of events, and there is no such thing as a "current event". Philosophically, an event has either happened or is yet to happen.

EventStream is a **lazy** observable. That means that it will not receive or process events unless it has at least one Observer (more on this below).

When you add an Observer to a stream, it starts to send events to the observer from now on. Different streams could potentially have custom code in them overriding this behaviour however. We strive for obviousness.

The result of calling `observable.addObserver(observer)(owner)` or `observable.foreach(onNext)(owner)` is a Subscription. To remove the observer manually, you can call `subscription.kill()`, but usually it's the `owner`'s job to do that. Hold that though for now, read about owners later in the [Ownership](#ownership) section.


### Laziness

Before exploring Signals, let's outline how exactly laziness works in Airstream. All Airstream Observables are lazy, but we will use EventStream-s here to make our explanation less abstract.

Every Observable has zero or more observers – both "external" observers that you add manually using `addObserver` or `foreach` methods, and InternalObserver-s. More on those soon.


#### Starting Observables

When a stream acquires its first observer (does not matter if external or internal), it is said to be **started**. So when you call `addObserver` on a stream for the first time, you **start** the stream. Airstream will then call the `stream.onStart` method, which must ensure that this stream wakes up and starts working. Someone started observing (caring about the output of) this stream – and so the stream must ensure that the events start coming in.

Usually the stream accomplishes that by adding an InternalObserver to the parent (upstream) stream – the stream on which this one depends. For example, let's consider this scenario:

```scala
val foo: EventStream[Foo] = ???
val bar: EventStream[Bar] = foo.map(fooToBar)
val baz: EventStream[Baz] = bar.map(barToBaz)
val qux: EventStream[Qux] = baz.map(bazToQux)
val rap: EventStream[Rap] = qux.map(quxToRap)

baz.addObserver(bazObserver)
```

Until `baz.addObserver(bazObserver)` was called, these streams would not be receiving or emitting any events because they have no observers, internal or external. After `baz.addObserver` is called, an external observer `bazObserver` is added to `baz`, starting it. Then, `baz.onStart` is called, adding `baz` as an InternalObserver to `bar`. `baz` will now receive and process any events emitted by `bar`.

But this means that `bar` just got its first observer – even if an internal one, it still matters – someone started caring, even if indirectly. So its `onStart` method is called, and it adds `bar` as the first InternalObserver to `foo`. Now, `foo` is started as well, and its `onStart` method does _something_ to ensure that `foo` will now start sending out events. We don't actually know what `foo`'s `onStart` method does because we didn't define `foo`'s implementation. For example, it could be adding a DOM listener to a DOM element.

Now we see how adding an observer resulted in a chain of activations of all upstream streams that were required, directly or indirectly, to get the events out of the stream we actually wanted to observe. The `onStart` method ensured – recursively – that the observed stream is now running.

Adding another observer to the now already running streams – `foo` or `bar` or `baz` – would not need to cause such a chain reaction because the stream to which it is being added already has observers (internal or external).

Lastly, notice that the `qux` and `rap` streams are untouched by all this. No one cares for their output yet, so those streams will not receive any events, and neither `bazToQux` nor `quxToRap` will ever run (well, not until we add observers that need them to run, directly or indirectly).

On a lower level, how exactly is it that `qux` will not run? Put simply, it needs to be getting events from `baz` to process them and produce its own events, but it's getting nothing from `baz` simply because at this point `baz` does not know that `qux` exists. `baz` sends out its events to all of its observers, but so far nothing added `qux` as an observer to `baz`.

For extra clarity, while the stream `rap` does depend on `qux`, `rap` itself has no observers, so it is **stopped**. Nothing started it yet, and so nothing triggered its `onStart` method which would have added `rap` as an InternalObserver to `qux`, starting `qux` recursively as described above. 


#### Stopping Observables

Just like Observers can be added to streams, they can also be removed, e.g. with `subscription.kill()`. When you remove the last observer (internal or external) from a stream, the stream is said to be **stopped**. The same domino effect as when starting streams applies, except the `onStop` method recursively undoes everything that was done by `onStart` – instead of adding an InternalObserver to parent stream, we remove it, and if that causes the grand-parent stream to be stopped, we call its `onStop` method, and the chain continues upstream. 

When the dust settles, streams that are now without observers (internal or external) will be stopped, and those that still have observers will otherwise be untouched, except they will stop referencing the now-stopped observables in their lists of internal observers.


#### Memory Management Implications

Every observable that depends on another – parent, or upstream observable, – always has a reference to that parent, regardless of whether it's started or stopped.

However, the parent/upstream observable has no references to its child/downstream observable(s) until the child observable is started. Only then does the parent obtain a reference to the child, adding it to the list of its internal observers. 

This has straightforward memory management implications: nothing in Airstream is keeping references to a *stopped* observable. So, if you don't have any of your own references to a stopped Observable, it will be garbage collected, as expected.  

However, a started observable has additional references to it from:
 1) The parent/upstream observable on which this observable depends (via the parent's list of internal observers)
 2) The Subscription objects created by `addObserver` or `foreach` calls on this observable, if this observable has external observers. Those subscriptions are in turn references by their Owner-s (more on those later)

Remember that if a given observable is started, its parent is also guaranteed to be started, and so on. This creates a potentially long chain of observables that typically terminate with external observers on the downstream end, and some kind of an event producer on the upstream end. All of these reference each other, directly or indirectly, and so will not be garbage collected unless there are no more references in your program to any observable or observer in this whole graph.

Now imagine that in the chain of activated observables mentioned above the most downstream observable is related to a UI component that has since then been destroyed. You would want that now-irrelevant observable to be stopped in order for it to be garbage collected, since it's not needed anymore, but it will continue to run for as long as it has its observer. And if you forgot to remove that observer when you destroyed the UI component it related to, you got yourself a memory leak.  

This is a common memory management pattern for most streaming libraries out there, so it should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with event streams.

Some reactive UI libraries such as Outwatch give you a way to bind the lifecycle of subscriptions to the lifecycle of corresponding UI components, and that automatically kills the subscription (removes the observer) when the UI component it relates to is destroyed. However, the underlying streaming libraries that such UI libraries use have no concept of such binding, and so in those libraries you can manually call `stream.addObserver` and create a subscription that will not cease to exist together with the UI component that it conceptually relates to.

What makes Airstream special is a built-in concept of ownership. When creating a leaky resource, e.g. when calling `addObserver`, you _have to_ also provide a reference to the Owner who will eventually kill the subscription. For example, that owner could be a UI component to which the subscription relates, and it could automatically kill all subscriptions that it owns when it is destroyed, allowing the now-irrelevant observables to be stopped and garbage collected. This is how [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar)'s `ReactiveElement` works. For more details, see the [Ownership](#ownership) section.



### Signal

Signal is a reactive variable that represents a time-varying value, or an accumulated value. In other words, "state".

Similar to EventStream, Signal is **lazy**, so everything in the [Laziness](#laziness) section applies to Signals as well.

Unlike EventStream, a Signal always has a current value. For instance, you could create a Signal by calling `val signal = eventStream.toSignal(initialValue)`. In that example, `signal`'s current value would first equal to `initialValue`, and then any time `eventStream` emits a value, `signal`'s current value would be updated to the emitted value, and then `signal` would emit this new current value.

However, all of that would only happen if `signal` had one or more observers (because of [Laziness](#laziness)). If `signal` had no observers, its current value would be stuck at the last current value it saved while it had observers, or at `initialValue` if it _never_ had observers.

Unlike EventStream, Signal only fires an event when its next value is different from its current value. The comparison is made using Scala's `==` operator.

When adding an Observer to a Signal, it will immediately receive its current value, as well as any future values. If you don't want the observer to receive the current value, observe the stream `signal.changes` instead.

Note: Signal's initial value is evaluated lazily where it is not provided explicitly. For example:

```scala
val fooStream: EventStream[Foo] = ???
val fooSignal: Signal[Foo] = fooStream.toSignal(myFoo)
val barSignal: Signal[Bar] = fooSignal.map(fooToBar)
```

In this example, `barSignal`'s initial value would be equal to `fooToBar(myFoo)`, but that expression will not be evaluated until it is needed (i.e. until `barSignal` acquires an observer). And once evaluated, it will not be re-evaluated again.

#### Getting Signal's current value

Signal's laziness means that its current value might get stale / inconsistent in the absence of observers. Airstream therefore does not allow you to access a Signal's current value _without proving that it has observers_. 

You can use `stream.withCurrentValueOf(signal).map((lastStreamEvent, signalCurrentValue) => ???)` to access `signal`'s current value. The resulting stream will still be lazy, but this way the processing of `currentValue` is just as lazy as `currentValue` itself, so there is no risk of looking at a stale `currentValue`.

If you don't need lastStreamEvent, use `stream.sample(signal).map(signalCurrentValue => ???)` instead. Note: both of these output streams will emit only when `stream` emits, as documented in the code. If you want updates from signal to also trigger an event, look into the `combineWith` operator.

If you want to get a Signal's current value without the complications of sampling, or even if you just want to make sure that a Signal is started, just call `observe` on it. That will add a noop observer to the signal, and return a `SignalViewer` instance which does expose `now()` and `tryNow()` methods that safely provide you with the signal's current value.


### Relationship between EventStream and Signal

Signals and EventStreams are distinct concepts, but both are Observables.

You can `fold(initialValue)(fn)` an EventStream into a Signal, or make a Signal directly with `stream.toSignal(initialValue)`, or `stream.toWeakSignal` (which initially starts out with `None`, and has events wrapped in `Some`).

You can get an EventStream of `changes` from a Signal – this stream will re-emit whatever the parent signal emits (subject to laziness of the stream), minus the initial value.


### Observer

`Observer[A]` is a modest wrapper around an `onNext: A => Unit` callback that represents an _external_ observer (see sections above for the distinction with internal observers). Observers have no knowledge of which observables, if any, they're observing, they have no power to choose whether they want to observe an observable, etc.

Observers are intended to contain side effects, and to trigger evaluation of observables (which, remember, are lazy).

You usually create observers with `Observer.apply` or `Observable.foreach`. There are a few more methods on Observer that support [error handling](#error-handling)

Observers have a couple convenience methods:

`def contramap[B](project: B => A): Observer[B]` – This is useful for separation of concerns. For example your Ajax service might expose an `Observer[Request]`, but you don't want a simple `UserProfile` component to know about your Ajax implementation details (`Request`), so you can instead provide it with `requestObserver.contramap(makeUpdateRequest)` which is a `Observer[User]`.

`def filter(passes: A => Boolean): Observer[A]` – useful if you have an `Observable` that you need to observe while filtering out some events (there is no `Observable.filter` method).


## Ownership

Alright, this is it. By now you've read enough to have many questions about how ownership works. This assumes you've read all the docs above, but to recap the core problem that ownership solves:

* Adding an `Observer` to the lazily evaluated `Observable` is a leaky operation. That is, this bond will survive even if the observable and the observer are both effectively unreachable to user code. This is because the observable's parent observables will keep a reference to it for as long as it has observers.
* Therefore, you need to remember to remove observers that you added when the observers are no longer needed.
* But doing that manually is insane, you will eventually forget and cause memory leaks and undesired behaviour. You should not need to take out your own garbage in a garbage collected language.

If any of the above does not make sense, the rest of this section might be confusing. Make sure you at least understand the entirety of the [Laziness](#laziness) section before proceeding.

Without further ado:

**Owned** is a resource that must be killed in order to release memory or prevent some other leak. In Airstream, `Subscription` (the result of `observable.addObserver` call) and `EventBusSource` (more on that later) both extend Owned.

Every Owned has an **Owner**. An Owner is an object that keeps track of its possessions (Owned-s) and knows when to kill them, and kills them _when it's time_. Airstream does not have any concrete Owner classes, just the base trait. The reactive UI library or even yourself should implement those.

For example, in my reactive UI library [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar) ReactiveElement (an object representing a JS DOM Element) implements Owner. When a ReactiveElement is discarded (unmounted from the DOM), it kills all of its `possessions`, i.e. all the Subscriptions that were bound to it.

So, if you're writing a Laminar component and want it to have an internal subscription, you would specify that component as the owner of said subscription. Then when the component is no longer needed, neither is that subscription, and the component conveniently kills it, removing its observer from any upstream observables it depended on. And if any of those don't have any more observers, they would be stopped, and if they are not referenced elsewhere in your code, garbage collected.

_@TODO[Docs] ^ Clean up the previous paragraph, it's not a great example anymore now that we don't have strict State observables._

When implementing Owned, you can perform whatever leaky operations you wanted in its constructor, and override the `onKilled` method to perform any required cleanup.

Owned-s are bound to a specific Owner upon creation of the Owned, and this link stays unchanged for the lifetime of the Owned.

Owned-s are normally killed _by their Owner_, but you can also override the `owned.kill` method to make it public, like `Subscription` does. That will let you kill an Owned manually. The Owner will be notified about this via `owner.onKilledExternally(owned)` so that it can drop the reference to the killed `owned` from its possessions.

An Owned can only be killed once. Killing the same Owned multiple times is undefined behaviour, don't do it. Built-in Owner tracks its kills properly, make sure to preserve that behaviour if extending it. 


### Ownership & Memory Management

In broad terms, ownership solves memory leaks by tying the lifecycle of Owned-s which would be otherwise hard to track manually to the lifecycle of an Owner which is expected to be tracked automatically by a UI library like Laminar.

In practice, Airstream's memory management has no magic to it. It uses Javascript's standard garbage collection, same as the rest of your Scala.js code. You just need to understand what references what, and the documentation here explains it.

For example, Subscription keeps references to both the Observable and the Observer that it bound. That means that if you're keeping a reference to a Subscription, you're also keeping those references. Given that the Subscription has a `kill` method that lets you remove the observer from the observable, the presence of these references should be obvious. So like I said – no magic, you just need to internalize the basic ideas of lazy observables, just like you've already internalized the basic ideas of classes and functions.


### Sources of Events

We now understand how events propagate through streams and signals, but the events in Airstream have to _originate_ somewhere, right?


#### Creating Observables from Futures

`EventStream.fromFuture[A]` creates a stream that emits the value that the future completes with, when that happens.
* The event is emitted asynchronously relative to the future's completion
* Creating a stream from an already completed future results in a stream that emits no events (look into the source code of this method for an easy way to get different behaviour)

`Signal.fromFuture[A]` creates a Signal of `Option[A]` that emits the value that the future completes with, when that happens, wrapped in `Some()`.
* The event is emitted asynchronously relative to the future's completion
* The initial value of this signal is equal to `Some(value)` if the future was already completed when the initial value was evaluated, or `None` otherwise.
* Unlike other signals, this signal keeps its current value from going stale even in the absence of observers

Note that all observables created from futures fire their events in a new transaction because they don't have a parent observable to be synchronous with.

Now that you have an `Observable[Future[A]]`, you can flatten it into `Observable[A]` in a few ways, see [Flattening Observables](#flattening-observables).

A failed future results in an error (see [Error Handling](#error-handling)).

#### EventStream.fromSeq

```scala
object EventStream {
  def fromSeq[A](events: Seq[A]): EventStream[A] = ...
  ...
}
```

This method creates an event stream that synchronously emits events from the provided sequence one by one to any newly added observer.

Each event is emitted in a separate transaction, meaning that the propagation of the previous event will fully complete before the propagation of the new event starts.

**Note:** you should avoid using this factory, at least with multiple events. You generally shouldn't need to emit more than one event at the same time like this stream does. If you do, I think your model is likely abusing the concept of "event". This method is provided as a kludge until I can make a more confident determination.


#### `EventStream.fromValue`

Like `EventStream.fromSeq` (see right above), but only allows for a single event.


#### `EventStream.fromTry`

Like `EventStream.fromValue` (see right above), but also allows an error.

This is provided as a kludge until it becomes more clear that this is not needed.


#### EventStream.periodic

TODO[API] – implement this.


#### EventBus

`new EventBus[MyEvent]` is the general-purpose way to create a stream on which you can manually trigger events. EventBus exposes two properties:

**`events`** is the stream of events emitted by the EventBus.

**`writer`** is a WriteBus object that lets you trigger EventBus events in a few ways.

WriteBus extends Observer, so you can call `onNext(newEventValue)` on it, or pass it as an observer to another stream's `addObserver` method. This will cause the event bus to emit `newEventValue` in a new transaction.

You can also call `addSource(otherStream)(owner)` on it, and the event bus will re-emit every event emitted by that stream. This is different from adding `writer` as an observer to `otherStream` because this will not cause otherStream to be started unless/until the EventBus's own stream is started (see [Laziness](#laziness)).

You've probably noticed that `addSource` takes `owner` as an implicit param – this is for memory management purposes. You would typically pass a WriteBus to a child component if you want the child to send any events to the parent. Thus, we want `addSource` to be automatically undone when said child is discarded (see [Ownership](#ownership)).

An EventBus can have multiple sources simultaneously. In that case it will emit events from all of those sources in the order in which they come in. EventBus emits every event in a new transaction. Note that EventBus lets you create loops of Observables. It is up to you to make sure that a propagation of an event through such loops eventually terminates (via a proper `.filter(passes)` gate for example, or the implicit `==` equality filter in Signal).

You can manually remove a previously added source stream using `removeSource` or by calling `kill()` on the EventBusSource object returned by the addSource call.

EventBus is particularly useful to get a single stream of events from a dynamic list of child components. You basically pass down the `writer` to every child component, and inside the child component you can add a source stream to it, or add it as an observer to some stream. Then when any given child component is discarded, its connection to the event bus will also be severed.

Typically you don't pass EventBus itself down to child components as it provides both read and write access. Instead, you pass down either the writer or the event stream, depending on what is needed. This security is the reason those are separate instances, by the way.

WriteBus comes with a way to create new writers. Consider this:

```scala
val eventBus = new EventBus[Foo]
val barWriter: WriteBus[Bar] = eventBus.writer.filterWriter(isGoodFoo).contramapWriter(barToFoo)
```

Now you can send `Bar` events to `barWriter`, and they will appear in `eventBus` processed with `barToFoo` then and filtered by `isGoodFoo`. This is useful when you want to get events from a child component, but the child component does not or should not know what `Foo` is. Generally if you don't need such separation of concerns, you can just `map`/`filter` the stream that's feeding the EventBus instead.


#### Var

`Var(initialValue)` / `Var.fromTry(tryValue)` contains `.signal` that you can update manually. Similar to `EventBus`, it exposes `.writer` for updates.


#### Val

`Val(value)` / `Val.fromTry(tryValue)` is a Signal "constant" – a Signal that never changes its value. Unlike other Signals, its value is evaluated immediately upon creation, and it exposes `now()` and `tryNow()` methods to obtain it.

Val is useful when a component wants to accept either a Signal or a constant value as input. You can just wrap your constant in a Val, and have the component accept a Signal instead.


#### Custom Observables

EventBus is a very generic solution that should suit most needs, even if perhaps not very elegantly sometimes.

You can create your own observables that emit events in their own unique way by wrapping or extending EventBus (easier) or extending Observable (more work and knowledge required)). For example, `Var` is implemented with EventBus.

Unfortunately I don't have enough time to describe how to create custom observables in detail right now. You will need to read the rest of the documentation and the source code – you will see how other observables such as MapEventStream or FilterEventStream are implemented. Airstream's source code should be easy to comprehend. It is clean, small (a bit more than 1K LoC with all the operators), and does not use complicated implicits or hardcore functional stuff.



### FRP Glitches

#### Other Libraries

A glitch in Functional Reactive Programming is a situation where inconsistent state is allowed to exist and exposed to either an observable or an observer. For example, consider the typical diamond case:

```scala
val numbers: EventStream[Int] = ???
val isPositive: EventStream[Boolean] = numbers.map(_ > 0)
val doubledNumbers: EventStream[Int] = numbers.map(_ * 2)
val combinedStream: EventStream[(Int, Boolean)] = doubledNumbers.combineWith(isPositive)
combinedStream.addObserver(combinedStreamObserver)(owner)
```

Now, without thinking too hard, what do you think `combinedStream` will emit when `numbers` emits `1`, assuming `-1` was previously emitted? You might expect that `isPositive` would emit `true`, `doubledNumbers` would emit `2`, and then combinedStream would emit a tuple `(2, true)`. That would make sense, and this is how Airstream works at no cost to you, and yet this is not how most streaming and state propagation libraries behave.

Most streaming libraries will introduce a **glitch** in this scenario, as they are implemented with unconditional depth-first propagation. So in other libraries when the event from `numbers` (`1`) propagates, it goes to `isPositive` (`true`), then to `combinedStream` (`(-1, true)`). And that's a glitch. `(-1, true)` is not a valid state, as -1 is not a positive number. Immediately afterwards, `doubledNumbers` will emit `1`, and finally combinedStream would emit `(1, true)`, the correct event.

Such behaviour is problematic in a few ways – first, you are now propagating two events on equal standing. Any observables (and in most other libraries, even observers!) downstream of `combinedStream` will see two events come in, the first one carrying invalid/incorrect state, and they will probably perform incorrect calculations or side effects because of that.

In general, glitches happen when you have an observable that _synchronously depends_ on multiple observables that _synchronously depend_ on a common ancestor or one of themselves. I'm using the term `synchronously depends` to describe a situation where emitting an event to a parent observable might result in the child observable also emitting it – synchronously. So `map` and `filter` would fall into this category, but `delay` wouldn't. 


#### Topological Rank

In the diamond-combine case described above Airstream avoids a glitch because CombineObservable-s (those created using the `combineWith` method) do not propagate downstream immediately. Instead, they are put into a `pendingObservables` queue in the current Transaction (we'll get to those soon). When the rest of the propagation within a transaction finishes, the propagation of the first pending observable is resumed. When that is finished, we propagate the first remaining pending observable, and so on.

So in our example, what happens in Airstream: after `isPositive` emits `true`, `combinedStream` is notified that one of its parents emitted a new event. Instead of emitting its own event, it adds itself to the list of pending observables. Then, as the `isPositive` branch finished propagating (for now), `doubledNumbers` emits `2`, and then again notifies `combinedStream` about this. `combinedStream` is already pending, so it just grabs and remembers the new value from this parent. At this point the propagation of `numbers` is complete (assuming no other branches exist), and Airstream checks `pendingObservables`on the current transaction. It finds only one – `combinedStream`, and re-starts the propagation from there. The only thing left to do in our example is to send the new event – `(2, true)` to `combinedStreamObserver`.

Now, only this simple example could work with such logic. The important bit that makes this work for complex observable graphs is topological rank. Topological rank in Airstream is defined as follows: if observable A _synchronously depends_ (see definition above) on observable B, its topological rank will be greater than that of B. In practical terms, `doubledNumbers.topoRank = numbers.topoRank + 1` and `combinedStream.topoRank == max(isPositive.topoRank, doubledNumbers.topoRank) + 1`.

In case of `combineWith`, Airstream uses topological rank for one thing – do determine which of the pending observables to resolve first. So when I said that Airstream continues the propagation of the "first" pending observable, I meant the one with the lowest `topoRank` among pending observables. This ensures that if you have more than one combined observable pending, that the one that doesn't depend on the other one will be propagated first.

So this is how Airstream avoids the glitch in the diamond-combine case.


#### Transactions

Before we dive into other kinds of glitches (ha! you thought that was it!?), we need to know what a Transaction is.

Philosophically, a Transaction in Airstream encapsulates a part of the propagation that 1) happens synchronously, and 2) contains no loops of observables. Within the confines of a single Transaction Airstream guarantees no glitches.

Async streams such as `stream.delay(500)` emit their events in a new transaction because Airstream executes transactions sequentially – and there is no sense in keeping other transactions blocked until some Promise or Future decides to resolve itself.

Events that come from outside of Airstream – see [Event Sources](#event-sources) – each come in in a new Transaction, and those source observables have a `topoRank` of 1. I guess it makes sense why `EventStream.periodic` would behave that way, but why wouldn't `EventBus` reuse the transaction of whatever event came in from one of its source streams?

And the answer is the limitation of our topological ranking approach: it does not work for loops of observables. A topoRank is a property of an observable, not of the event coming in. And an observable's topoRank is determined at its creation. EventBus on its creation has no sources, so its stream needs to emit its events in a new Transaction because there is no way to guarantee correct topological ranking to avoid glitches.

That said, in practice this is not a big deal because the events that an EventBus receives from different sources should be usually independent of each other because they are coming from different child components.

Apart from EventBus there is another way to create a loop – the `eventStream.flatten` method. And that one too, produces an event stream that emits all events in a new transaction, for all the same reasons.

Loops necessarily break transactions as a tradeoff. Some other libraries do some kinds of dynamic topological sorting which is less predictable and whose performance worsens as your observables graph gets more complicated, but with Airstream there are no such costs. The only – and tiny – cost is when Airstream inserts a CombineObservable into the list of pending observables – that list is sorted by a static `topoRank` field, so it takes O(n) where n is the number of currently pending observables, which is usually zero or not much more than that.

Lastly, keep in mind that "propagation" does not include external observers. If you call `observable.addObserver`, the observer will create a new transaction for every event that it receives. This is because observers are generally for side effects. Part of those effects might be emitting events, but you don't want that to be affected by other propagations going on, which would happen if we reused a transactions for observers. Philosophically, Observers should not know what they're observing (and they can observe multiple things at a time).


#### Merge Glitch-By-Design

Consider this:

```scala
val numbers: EventStream[Int] = ???
val tens: EventStream[Boolean] = numbers.map(_ * 10)
val hundreds: EventStream[Int] = tens.map(_ * 10)
val multiples: EventStream[Int] = EventStream.merge(tens, hundreds)
multiples.addObserver(multiplesObserver)(owner)
```

Same deal – what do you expect `multiples` to emit when `numbers` emits 1? I admit, it's a loaded question because of how I named `multiples`. I expect it to emit 10, and then 100. 10 comes first not because magic, but because the stream `hundreds` _synchronously depends_ on `tens`. Or, more precisely, because its `topoRank` is higher. This behaviour is especially desirable when your events are effectively operations – you don't want the merged stream to swallow operations or to put them in the wrong order.

TODO[API] Consider ordering synchronous events by the order their streams are given to merge instead of topoRank.

In Airstream, MergeEventStream will not emit more than one event in the same Transaction, because a Transaction by its very definition is about propagating a single event (that it happens to sometimes be split into multiple branches e.g. `tens` and `hundreds` is irrelevant, it's still the same change propagating), whereas a merged stream is capable of creating new events out of thin air as shown here. So in this example `multiples` will emit 10 in the same transaction that `numbers` emitted 1 in, and it will then create a new transaction which will emit 100 when it gets its turn.

MergeEventStream uses the same pendingObservables mechanism as CombineObservable because both extend SyncObservable.


### Operators

Airstream supports standard observables operators like `map` / `filter` / etc. Some of the operators are available only on certain types of observables. For example, you currently can only `sample` an EventStream. This scarcity is sort of deliberate – we start out with the most basic / obvious operators and will expand into fancier ones as the need arises. However, some basic operators are also missing just because I didn't get to it yet (as opposed to by design), it's only for this reason there is no operator to combine more than two observables yet. 

There is currently no centralized documentation on operators – they are well annotated in the source code, in `Observable`, `EventStream`, and `Signal`.

#### Flattening Observables

Flattening generally refers to reducing the number of nested container layers. In Airstream the precise type definition can be found in the `FlattenStrategy` trait.

The `def flatten[...](implicit strategy: FlattenStrategy[...])` method is available on all observables by means of `MetaObservable` implicit value class. All you need is to provide it an instance of `FlattenStrategy` that works for your specific observable's type. While you can easily implement your own flattening strategy, we have a few predefined in Airstream:

**`SwitchStreamStrategy`** flattens an `Observable[EventStream[A]]` into an `EventStream[A]`. The resulting stream will emit events from the latest stream emitted by the parent observable. So, as the parent observable emits a new stream, the resulting flattened stream _switches_ to imitating this last emitted stream.
*  This strategy is the default for the parent observable type that it supports. So if you want to flatten an `Observable[EventStream[A]]` using this strategy, you don't need to pass it to `flatten` explicitly, it is provided implicitly.

**`SwitchFutureStrategy`** flattens an `Observable[Future[A]]` into an `EventStream[A]`. We first create an event stream from each emitted future, then flatten the result using `SwitchStreamStrategy`. So this ends up behaving very similarly, producing a stream that emits the value from the last future emitted by the parent observable, discarding the values of all previously emitted futures.

To summarize, the above strategies result in a stream that imitates the latest stream / future emitted by the parent observable. So as soon as the parent observable emits a new future / stream, it stops listening for values produced by previously emitted futures / streams.

**`ConcurrentFutureStrategy`** also flattens an `Observable[Future[A]]` into an `EventStream[A]`. Whenever a future emitted by the parent observable completes, this stream emits that value, regardless of any other futures emitted by the parent.

**`OverwriteFutureStrategy`** is similar to `ConcurrentFutureStrategy` except it does not emit the values of previous futures if a value from a newer future has already been emitted. For example, suppose the parent observable emits three futures. Future 3 is the first one to be completed, and when that happens the resulting flattened stream emits that value. When futures 1 and 2 eventually complete, their values will be ignored because they are considered stale, _overwritten_ by the more up to date result of future 3. This strategy is best for use cases like fetching autocompletion results where you don't care about older results if you have a newer result. 

All built-in strategies result in observables that emit each event in a new transaction for hopefully obvious reasons. 

`SwitchFutureStrategy`, `ConcurrentFutureStrategy`, and `OverwriteFutureStrategy` treat futures slightly differently than `EventStream.fromFuture`. Namely, if the parent observable emits a future that has already resolved, it will be treated as if the future has just resolved, i.e. its value will be emitted (subject to the strategy's normal logic). This is useful to avoid "swallowing" already resolved futures and enables easy handling of use cases such as cached or default responses. If this behaviour is undesirable you can easily define an alternative flattening strategy – it's a matter of flipping a single boolean in the relevant classes.
 


### Error Handling

Airstream error handling is very different from conventional streaming libraries. Before diving into implementation details we first need to understand these differences and the reasons why such a departure from the norm is beneficial.


#### Scala Exception Handling

First, to clarify what kind of errors we're talking about here: this whole section is concerned with exceptions thrown by _user-provided_ code inside Airstream observables. For example, consider the `project` function in `stream.map(project)` throwing. Without special error handling capabilities in Airstream, such an exception would terminate the propagation of this stream and bubble up the call stack.

However, this behaviour is vastly undesirable in FRP context because the caller (which would be the source of events) is not normally in a position to handle failures of child observables. For example, a DOM event listener that publishes DOM events onto a stream can't do much about some other component failing to process some of those events. So we need a different strategy to deal with errors in observables.


#### Conventional Streaming Libraries

Conventional streaming libraries basically don't propagate errors in observables. If your stream fails, it gets _completed_, meaning that it informs all of its dependant observables and observers that it will no longer produce events, and is now shutting down forever.

If you don't want this outcome, you need to _recover_ from such an error by creating a stream that takes two inputs: this original stream, and a stream factory that returns a new stream that you will switch to if the original stream errors. 

This model does not make any sense to me. Consider this chain of observables:

```scala
object OtherModule {
  def doubled(parentStream: Stream[Double]): parent: Stream[Double] = {
    parent.map(num => num * 2)
  }
}
 
// ----
 
import OtherModule.doubled
 
val stream1: Stream[Double] = ???
val invertedStream: Stream[Double] = stream1.map(num => 1 / num)
 
doubled(invertedStream).foreach(dom.console.log(_))
```

Inside `doubled`, there is nothing you can do to recover from an error in `parentStream`. You don't know what that stream does, so once it's broke, it's broke. You can't replace it with anything meaningful, just maybe some sentinel value to indicate failure.

So essentially, this requires you to either manually guard every single user-provided input to every stream, or lose your sanity to crazy amounts of coupling. In this scenario the more likely outcome is that you'll just ignore error handling, and your program will stop working on an error that would have been recoverable if only it wasn't in your streaming code.

Fundamentally, the problem here is conceptual: conventional streaming libraries see any exception in a stream as a terminal diagnosis for it.

Yes, such an error could have made parts of your application state inconsistent, that is a legitimate problem. However, unconditionally killing parts of your program that depend on a stream is not a way to mitigate inconsistent state for the simple reason that _the streaming library has no idea which, if any, state became inconsistent_, therefore it has no idea whether allowing the error to propagate will _mitigate_ state breakage or make it _even worse_.


#### Airstream's Approach

Airstream aspires to replicate the feel of native exception handling in FRP. However, whereas in imperative code we _want_ Scala to propagate exceptions up the call stack, in Airstream we instead want to propagate errors in observables to their observers and dependent observables.

Think about it this way: in imperative code, you call a function which can throw, and you can either handle it or decide to let your caller handle it, and so on, recursively. In Airstream, you make an observable that depends on another observable which can throw. So you can either handle it, or let any downstream observables or observers handle it.

This FRP adaptation of classic exception handling is somewhat similar to the approach of Scala.rx, however since Airstream offers a unified reactive system, we have to adjust this basic idea to support event streams as well.

To contrast our approach with conventional streaming libraries, where they see a failed _stream_, we only see a failed _value_, generally expecting the next emitted value to work fine. This is similar to plain Scala exceptions: if a function throws an exception, it does not suddenly become broken forever. You can call it again with perhaps a different value, and it will perhaps not fail that time. Yes, if such an exception produces invalid state, you as a programmer need to address it. Same in Airstream. We give you the tools (more on this below), you do the work, because you're the only one who knows _how_.

We elaborate on the call stack analogy in the subsection [Errors Multiply](#errors-multiply) below.


#### Error propagation

Airstream does not complete or terminate observables on error. Instead, we essentially propagate error values the same way we propagate normal values. Each Observer and InternalObserver has `onNext(A)` and `onError(Throwable)` methods defined, so both observables and observers are capable of accepting error values as inputs.

If you do not take special action, Airstream observables will generally (but not always, we'll get to that) pass through the errors to their observers untouched. Eventually the error will reach one or more external Observers.

When an error reaches an external observer, its `onError` method will handle it. If you didn't specify `onError` (e.g. if you used the `Observer(onNext)` factory to create an observer) or if your `onError` partial function is not defined for a given error, Airstream will report this error as _unhandled_.

You can get notified about unhandled errors by registering a callback using `AirstreamError.registerUnhandledErrorCallback(fn: Throwable => Unit)`. Similarly, you can unregister it using `AirstreamError.unregisterUnhandledErrorCallback(fn: Throwable => Unit)`.

By default Airstream registers `AirstreamErrors.consoleErrorCallback` to log all errors to the console because there is nothing worse than silently swallowed unhandled errors. You can unregister it and/or register more callbacks, e.g. to terminate your program, or to report the error to a service like Sentry.

Now let's dive deeper into each step of this process.

##### User Input is Generally Guarded Against Exceptions

Airstream guards from exceptions almost all user (developer) inputs that are used to build observables. For example, if the `project` function that you provided to `stream.map(project)` throws an exception, the resulting stream will emit an error, kick-starting this whole error handling process.

However, user inputs that are supposed to return a `Try` are assumed to not throw. Various public class constructors that require the `new` keyword are generally not intended to be used directly, these can also have params that are not guarded against exceptions.

For clarity, every Airstream method and constructor available to you has a Scaladoc comment reaffirming whether its parameters are guarded or not.

##### Errors Do Not Affect Propagation

When an error happens in an observable (assuming that it was guarded against, as it should always be, see above), the observable emits this error to all of its observers – internal and external – in the same manner that it would emit a value. Think of it as propagating a `Try[A]` value instead of just `A`.

##### Errors in an Observer Do Not Affect Other Observers

Similarly, and unlike conventional streaming libraries, if an error happened in an observer's `onNext` or `onError` callback, this error will be reported as _unhandled_, but it will not prevent other observers or the code immediately following this observer's definition from running.

If you're concerned that the contents of your `onNext` / `onError` can fail and make your app state inconsistent, you do the same thing you've always done in this situation – `try` some code and `catch` the error, just keep it all inside the callback in question:

```scala
stream.addObserver(Observer(onNext = v =>
  try { riskyFoo(v) }
  catch { case err => recoverFromFooFail() }
))
```

Remember, this is just for observers. We have a better way for observables, read on.

##### Unhandled Errors Do Not Terminate The Program

In Airstream, unhandled errors do not result in the program terminating. By default they are reported to the console. You can specify different or additional handlers such as `AirstreamError.debuggerErrorCallback` or even a custom handler that effectively terminates your program.

Regardless of this seeming leniency, you should still handle all of your errors at some point before they become _unhandled_. In a good Airstream codebase every _unhandled_ error must be treated as a bug.

##### Error Timing is Consistent

Observables generally emit errors at the same time as they would have emitted a non-error value. For example, a `CombinedObservable` like `stream.combineWith(stream.map(foo))` will only emit a single value if `stream` emits a value (yes, Airstream deals with [FRP Glitches](#frp-glitches) for you). Similarly, it will only emit a single error if `stream` emits an error. However, that error will be wrapped in `CombinedError` because it needs to support the case when its parent observables simultaneously emit a different error.

On the other hand, `MergeEventStream` does no such synchronization, it emits the errors similarly to how it emits non-error events – as they come, putting all but the first seen one in a new transaction.

`DelayEventStream` re-emits incoming errors with the same delay that it uses for normal values.

##### Event Streams Generally Forget Errors

Similarly to how event streams generally do not keep track of their last emitted value, they also forget their last emitted error once they finish propagating it to their observers.

##### Memory Observables Remember Errors

If a `Signal[A]` observable runs into an error that it doesn't handle itself, this error becomes its current state. `Signal`s' current state is actually `Try[A]`, not just `A`. 

`SignalViewer[A]` has a public `now(): A` method that returns its signal's current value. Calling it is equivalent to `tryNow().get`– it will throw if current state is a Failure.

##### Errors Can Become Wrapped 

Errors originating in an external Observer's onNext and onTry methods are wrapped in `ObserverError` and `ObserverErrorHandlingError` respectively before they are shipped off as unhandled errors.

Errors originating in observables error handling code (`stream.recover(pf)`) are wrapped in `ErrorHandlingError`.

You can always access the original errors on wrapped errors, and it will always provide you with a stack trace that includes the line where your code failed. Make sure to configure error reporting as well as Scala.js source maps to make use of this in fullOpt / production.

##### Errors Multiply

The same error might need to be handled multiple times to avoid becoming _unhandled_.

It is perhaps counter-intuitive, but it's obvious in retrospect:

```scala
val upStream = ???
val fooStream = upStream.map(foo)
val barStream = upStream.map(bar)
fooStream.foreach(dom.console.log("foo"))
barStream.foreach(dom.console.log("bar"))
```

If `upStream` emits an error, both `fooStream` and `barStream` will emit an error – the same instance of it, actually. Then it will end up reported as _unhandled_ – twice!

If we try to lean on our call stack analogy, it kinda breaks this time. Call stack is a stack, a linear data structure much like a list. An exception can only ever bubble to just one caller before bubbling up to its one and only caller. But in our case it feels like the bubbles are splitting into multiple parallel "streams".

Instead, think of `fooStream` and `barStream` as independent function **calls** that both require the value of `upStream`, except by magic of FRP `upStream` is only executed once and its value (well, its exception in this case) is shared with both `fooStream` and `barStream` calls. If you call a broken function twice, you get two exceptions (identical ones, thanks to FRP) and thus two call stacks to propagate through.

To be extra clear, if we add `.recoverIgnoreErrors` to the `fooStream` definition above, its observer will not receive the error coming from `upStream`, and will not report that error as _unhandled_. We did, after all, handle it, so that's fair. However, `barStream`'s observer would still receive that same error, and would still report it as _unhandled_. This is why handling errors in the right place is very important, just like handling exceptions is in plain Scala code.


#### Recovering from Errors

As we mentioned, generally observables propagate the errors they receive with no change. However, we can recover from errors, like this:

```scala
val signal0: Signal[A] = ???
val signal1 = signal0.map(whatever)
val signal2 = signal1.recover {
  case MyException(foo) if foo.isGood => Some(foo) // emit foo
  case MyException(foo) if !foo.isGood => None // skip this, emit nothing
  case o: MyOtherException => throw new Exception("lolwat") // emit new error
}
```

Importantly, this `recover` method does not affect `signal0`, or even `signal1`. Like any other operator it's just creating a new observable (`signal2`), except this one has a defined error handling strategy, so it will process any errors that come through it.

When `signal0` emits an error, `signal2` will feed it to the partial function we provided to it. That function should normally emit either `Some(value)` to make `signal2` emit some `value`, or `None` to just skip this event altogether, as if it never happened. Yes, this latter case means that `signal2`'s current state would remain at whatever it was before this error came in, meanwhile `signal0`'s current state would be updated to the error (same for `signal1`).

Any errors that this partial function is not defined for will pass through without being handled. If the partial function throws an error, it will be passed down wrapped in `ErrorHandlingError`.

In addition to `recover`, Observables have a couple shorthand operators:

**`recoverIgnoreErrors`** just skips all errors, emitting only good values. This is an FRP equivalent of an empty catch block.

Note that you can't ignore an error in a `Signal`'s initial value, as it _needs_ a `Try[A]` value to be its state whenever it's started. Therefore, if the initial value is an error, and `recover` returns `None` while handling it (that's what `recoverIgnoreErrors` does), the initial value is set to the original error.

**`recoverToTry`** transforms an `Observable[A]` into an `Observable[Try[A]]` that never emits an error (it emits `Failure(err)` as a value instead).

You can use it to get a stream of errors as plain values, for example:

```scala
stream.recoverToTry.collect { case Failure(err) => err } // EventStream[Throwable]
```


#### Handling Errors Using Observers

**`Observer.withRecover(onNext, onError: PartialFunction[Throwable, Unit])`** lets you handle some or all of the errors coming from upstream observables. Errors for which `onError` is not defined get reported as unhandled.

**`Observer.ignoreErrors(onNext)`** is similar to `recoverIgnoreErrors` on observables – it simply silences any error it receives, so that it does not get reported as unhandled.


#### Other Error Handling Considerations

* **`fold`** operator is unable to proceed when encountering an error, so such an observable will enter a permanent error state if it encounters an error. You can not use the standard `recover` method to recover from this. You need to use `foldRecover` instead of `fold` to supply your error handling logic.

* **`filter`** operator can't filter if its passes function fails, so it will pass through all errors that it receives, unfiltered. You can filter errors using `recover`, by returning `None`.

* Remember that Signal's initial value is not evaluated until and unless it is needed. That is true even if the initial value would have been an error because obviously you can't know what it is without evaluating it. And if an error is not evaluated, then it can't possibly be reported anywhere because, well, it didn't actually happen. In practice this means that the initial value of a Signal whose only consumer is its `.changes` stream is completely ignored (because no one cares about it). @TODO[API] Should we reconsider this particular aspect of laziness? Either way, we should document the rationale for that some more.

* This is an unfortunately flawed edge case in our design. We might address that eventually. Please let me know if you run into this problem.

* Signals can also potentially face a similar issue, but the scenario allowing it is even more convoluted because a signal's initial value is evaluated lazily – only if and when its observers request it – so it can't really throw an error if no one is looking at it.





## Limitations

* Currently Airstream only runs on Scala.js because its primary intended use case is unidirectional dataflow architecture on the frontend. However, its design is very generic, and it is definitely possible to make Airstream work on JVM, but that is complicated by 1) JVM's multithreaded environment, 2) Airstream using JS-specific data structures such as js.Array that do not exist on the JVM, and 3) me having limited time, and no personal need for Airstream on the JVM. Those are solvable.
* Airstream has no concept of observables "completing". Personally I don't think this is a limitation, but I can see it being viewed as such. If you would like to make a case for this feature, please file an issue on github.
